1.
At every door-way,
ere one enters,
one should spy round,
one should pry round
for uncertain is the witting
that there be no foeman sitting,
within, before one on the floor

2. 
Hail, ye Givers! a guest is come; 
say! where shall he sit within? 
Much pressed is he who fain on the hearth 
would seek for warmth and weal.

3. 
He hath need of fire, who now is come, 
numbed with cold to the knee; 
food and clothing the wanderer craves 
who has fared o'er the rimy fell.

4. 
He craves for water, who comes for refreshment, 
drying and friendly bidding, 
marks of good will, fair fame if 'tis won, 
and welcome once and again.

5. 
He hath need of his wits who wanders wide, 
aught simple will serve at home; 
but a gazing-stock is the fool who sits 
mid the wise, and nothing knows.

6. 
Let no man glory in the greatness of his mind, 
but rather keep watch o'er his wits. 
Cautious and silent let him enter a dwelling; 
to the heedful comes seldom harm, 
for none can find a more faithful friend 
than the wealth of mother wit.

7. 
Let the wary stranger who seeks refreshment 
keep silent with sharpened hearing; 
with his ears let him listen, and look with his eyes; 
thus each wise man spies out the way.

8. 
Happy is he who wins for himself 
fair fame and kindly words; 
but uneasy is that which a man doth own 
while it lies in another's breast.

9. 
Happy is he who hath in himself 
praise and wisdom in life; 
for oft doth a man ill counsel get 
when 'tis born in another's breast.

10. 
A better burden can no man bear 
on the way than his mother wit; 
'tis the refuge of the poor, and richer it seems 
than wealth in a world untried.

11. 
A better burden can no man bear 
on the way than his mother wit: 
and no worse provision can he carry with him 
than too deep a draught of ale.

12. 
Less good than they say for the sons of men 
is the drinking oft of ale: 
for the more they drink, the less can they think 
and keep a watch o'er their wits.

13. 
A bird of Unmindfulness flutters o'er ale feasts, 
wiling away men's wits: 
with the feathers of that fowl I was fettered once 
in the garths of Gunnlos below.

14. 
Drunk was I then, I was over drunk 
in that crafty JÃ¶tun's court. 
But best is an ale feast when man is able 
to call back his wits at once.

15. 
Silent and thoughtful and bold in strife 
the prince's bairn should be. 
Joyous and generous let each man show him 
until he shall suffer death.

16. 
A coward believes he will ever live 
if he keep him safe from strife: 
but old age leaves him not long in peace 
though spears may spare his life.

17. 
A fool will gape when he goes to a friend, 
and mumble only, or mope; 
but pass him the ale cup and all in a moment 
the mind of that man is shown.

18. 
He knows alone who has wandered wide, 
and far has fared on the way, 
what manner of mind a man doth own 
who is wise of head and heart.

19. 
Keep not the mead cup but drink thy measure; 
speak needful words or none: 
none shall upbraid thee for lack of breeding 
if soon thou seek'st thy rest.

20. 
A greedy man, if he be not mindful, 
eats to his own life's hurt: 
oft the belly of the fool will bring him to scorn 
when he seeks the circle of the wise.

21. 
Herds know the hour of their going home 
and turn them again from the grass; 
but never is found a foolish man 
who knows the measure of his maw.

22. 
The miserable man and evil minded 
makes of all things mockery, 
and knows not that which he best should know, 
that he is not free from faults.

23. 
The unwise man is awake all night, 
and ponders everything over; 
when morning comes he is weary in mind, 
and all is a burden as ever.

24. 
The unwise man weens all who smile 
and flatter him are his friends, 
nor notes how oft they speak him ill 
when he sits in the circle of the wise.

25. 
The unwise man weens all who smile 
and flatter him are his friends; 
but when he shall come into court he shall find 
there are few to defend his cause.

26. 
The unwise man thinks all to know, 
while he sits in a sheltered nook; 
but he knows not one thing, what he shall answer, 
if men shall put him to proof.

27. 
For the unwise man 'tis best to be mute 
when he come amid the crowd, 
for none is aware of his lack of wit 
if he wastes not too many words; 
for he who lacks wit shall never learn 
though his words flow ne'er so fast.

28. 
Wise he is deemed who can question well, 
and also answer back: 
the sons of men can no secret make 
of the tidings told in their midst.

29. 
Too many unstable words are spoken 
by him who ne'er holds his peace; 
the hasty tongue sings its own mishap 
if it be not bridled in.

30. 
Let no man be held as a laughing-stock, 
though he come as guest for a meal: 
wise enough seem many while they sit dry-skinned 
and are not put to proof.

31. 
A guest thinks him witty who mocks at a guest 
and runs from his wrath away; 
but none can be sure who jests at a meal 
that he makes not fun among foes.

32. 
Oft, though their hearts lean towards one another,
friends are divided at table;
ever the source of strife 'twill be,
that guest will anger guest.

33. 
A man should take always his meals betimes
unless he visit a friend, 
or he sits and mopes, and half famished seems,
and can ask or answer nought.

34. 
Long is the round to a false friend leading, 
e'en if he dwell on the way: 
but though far off fared, to a faithful friend 
straight are the roads and short.

35. 
A guest must depart again on his way, 
nor stay in the same place ever; 
if he bide too long on another's bench 
the loved one soon becomes loathed.

36. 
One's own house is best, though small it may be; 
each man is master at home; 
though he have but two goats and a bark-thatched hut
'tis better than craving a boon.

37. 
One's own house is best, though small it may be,
each man is master at home; 
with a bleeding heart will he beg, who must, 
his meat at every meal.

38. 
Let a man never stir on his road a step
without his weapons of war; 
for unsure is the knowing when need shall arise 
of a spear on the way without.

39. 
I found none so noble or free with his food,
who was not gladdened with a gift, 
nor one who gave of his gifts such store 
but he loved reward, could he win it.

40. 
Let no man stint him and suffer need 
of the wealth he has won in life; 
oft is saved for a foe what was meant for a friend, 
and much goes worse than one weens.

41. 
With raiment and arms shall friends gladden each other, 
so has one proved oneself; 
for friends last longest, if fate be fair 
who give and give again.

42. 
To his friend a man should bear him as friend,
and gift for gift bestow,
laughter for laughter let him exchange,
but leasing pay for a lie.

43. 
To his friend a man should bear him as friend,
to him and a friend of his;
but let him beware that he be not the friend 
of one who is friend to his foe.

44. 
Hast thou a friend whom thou trustest well, 
from whom thou cravest good? 
Share thy mind with him, gifts exchange with him, 
fare to find him oft.

45. 
But hast thou one whom thou trustest ill 
yet from whom thou cravest good?
Thou shalt speak him fair, but falsely think,
and leasing pay for a lie.

46. 
Yet further of him whom thou trusted ill,
and whose mind thou dost misdoubt; 
thou shalt laugh with him but withhold thy thought, 
for gift with like gift should be paid.

47. 
Young was I once, I walked alone, 
and bewildered seemed in the way; 
then I found me another and rich I thought me, 
for man is the joy of man.

48. 
Most blest is he who lives free and bold
and nurses never a grief,
for the fearful man is dismayed by aught,
and the mean one mourns over giving.

49. 
My garments once I gave in the field
to two land-marks made as men; 
heroes they seemed when once they were clothed; 
'tis the naked who suffer shame!

50. 
The pine tree wastes which is perched on the hill, 
nor bark nor needles shelter it; 
such is the man whom none doth love; 
for what should he longer live?

51. 
Fiercer than fire among ill friends 
for five days love will burn; 
bun anon 'tis quenched, when the sixth day comes, 
and all friendship soon is spoiled.

52. 
Not great things alone must one give to another, 
praise oft is earned for nought;
with half a loaf and a tilted bowl 
I have found me many a friend.

53. 
Little the sand if little the seas, 
little are minds of men, 
for ne'er in the world were all equally wise, 
'tis shared by the fools and the sage.

54. 
Wise in measure let each man be;
but let him not wax too wise; 
for never the happiest of men is he
who knows much of many things.

55. 
Wise in measure should each man be; 
but let him not wax too wise;
seldom a heart will sing with joy 
if the owner be all too wise.

56. 
Wise in measure should each man be, 
but ne'er let him wax too wise:
who looks not forward to learn his fate
unburdened heart will bear.

57. 
Brand kindles from brand until it be burned,
spark is kindled from spark,
man unfolds him by speech with man, 
but grows over secret through silence.

58. 
He must rise betimes who fain of another 
or life or wealth would win;
scarce falls the prey to sleeping wolves,
or to slumberers victory in strife.

59. 
He must rise betimes who hath few to serve him, 
and see to his work himself; 
who sleeps at morning is hindered much, 
to the keen is wealth half-won.

60. 
Of dry logs saved and roof-bark stored
a man can know the measure, 
of fire-wood too which should last him out
quarter and half years to come.

61. 
Fed and washed should one ride to court 
though in garments none too new; 
thou shalt not shame thee for shoes or breeks, 
nor yet for a sorry steed.

62. 
Like an eagle swooping over old ocean, 
snatching after his prey, 
so comes a man into court who finds 
there are few to defend his cause.

63. 
Each man who is wise and would wise be called 
must ask and answer aright. 
Let one know thy secret, but never a second, --
if three a thousand shall know.

64. 
A wise counselled man will be mild in bearing
and use his might in measure,
lest when he come his fierce foes among
he find others fiercer than he.

65. 
Each man should be watchful and wary in speech,
and slow to put faith in a friend.
for the words which one to another speaks
he may win reward of ill.

66. 
At many a feast I was far too late,
and much too soon at some;
drunk was the ale or yet unserved: 
never hits he the joint who is hated.

67. 
Here and there to a home I had haply been asked
had I needed no meat at my meals,
or were two hams left hanging in the house of that friend 
where I had partaken of one.

68. 
Most dear is fire to the sons of men, 
most sweet the sight of the sun;
good is health if one can but keep it,
and to live a life without shame.

69. 
Not reft of all is he who is ill, 
for some are blest in their bairns,
some in their kin and some in their wealth,
and some in working well.

70. 
More blest are the living than the lifeless,
'tis the living who come by the cow;
I saw the hearth-fire burn in the rich man's hall
and himself lying dead at the door.

71. 
The lame can ride horse, the handless drive cattle, 
the deaf one can fight and prevail,
'tis happier for the blind than for him on the bale-fire,
but no man hath care for a corpse.

72. 
Best have a son though he be late born 
and before him the father be dead:
seldom are stones on the wayside raised
save by kinsmen to kinsmen.

73. 
Two are hosts against one, the tongue is the head's bane,
'neath a rough hide a hand may be hid;
he is glad at nightfall who knows of his lodging, 
short is the ship's berth, 
and changeful the autumn night,
much veers the wind ere the fifth day 
and blows round yet more in a month.

74. 
He that learns nought will never know
how one is the fool of another, 
for if one be rich another is poor 
and for that should bear no blame.

75. 
Cattle die and kinsmen die,
thyself too soon must die, 
but one thing never, I ween, will die, -- 
fair fame of one who has earned.

76. 
Cattle die and kinsmen die, 
thyself too soon must die, 
but one thing never, I ween, will die, -- 
the doom on each one dead.

77. 
Full-stocked folds had the Fatling's sons, 
who bear now a beggar's staff:
brief is wealth, as the winking of an eye,
most faithless ever of friends.

78. 
If haply a fool should find for himself 
wealth or a woman's love, 
pride waxes in him but wisdom never
and onward he fares in his folly.

79. 
All will prove true that thou askest of runes -- 
those that are come from the gods, 
which the high Powers wrought, and which Odin painted: 
then silence is surely best.
